A simple and interactive terminal-based version of Conway's Game of Life, written in Rust!
Customize the speed, draw your initial cells, and watch how the simulation evolves.

## Controls

| Key/Action | Effect |
|:---|:---|
| Left Mouse Button | Toggle cell state (alive/dead) |
| Enter | Start or pause the simulation |
| q | Quit the game |

## Running the project

You can run the project either with Cargo or inside a Docker container.

### Running with Cargo

> ‚ö° Note: The first build might take a few minutes as it downloads and compiles all dependencies.

Make sure you have Rust installed: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

```rust 
cargo run --release -q
```

You can also pass options:

```rust 
cargo run -q -- -f 10
```

### Running with Docker

> ‚ö° Note: The first Docker build can take a few minutes too, due to Rust compilation.

First, build the image:

```
docker build -t game-of-life .
```

Then run it interactively:

```
docker run -it game-of-life
```

You can also pass flags, just like when running directly:

```
docker run -it game-of-life -f 10
```

## CLI Help
